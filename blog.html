					<h2>How to care for your Monstera</h2>
					<p>
						Monstera are species of evergreen tropical vines/shrubs that are
						native to Central America. Monsteras are famous for their natural
						leaf-holes, and has led to the rise of its nickname, Swiss Cheese
						Plant. Two different species of Monstera are cultivated as
						houseplants - Monstera deliciosa and Monstera adansonii. Monstera
						adansonii is distinguished from M. deliciosa by having longer,
						tapering leaves, as well as having completely enclosed leaf holes.
						Monstera deliciosa leaf holes eventually grow towards the edge and
						open up as they mature.
					</p>
					<h4>Sunligth</h4>
					<p>
						Thrives in bright to medium indirect light. Not suited for intense,
						direct sun but can be acclimated to withstand it.
					</p>
					<h4>Water</h4>
					<p>
						Water every 1-2 weeks, allowing soil to dry out between waterings.
						Expect to water more often in brighter light and less often in lower
						light.
					</p>
					<p>
						Monsteras can benefit from filtered water or leaving water out
						overnight before using.
					</p>
					<h4>Temperature</h4>
					<p>
						65°F-85°F (18°C-30°C). It’s best not to let it go below 60°F (15°C).

					<h2>Easy green plants</h2>
					<p>
						Maybe you had an indoor plant once and it very quickly turned into a
						wilting, yellowing embarrassment. Or, maybe you’ve never owned an
						indoor plant because you aren’t sure if you can keep it alive.
					</p>
					<p>
						Don’t get discouraged! Success with houseplants starts with finding
						the right plant for you. Maybe you just need an indoor plant that
						won’t mind if you forget to water it once in a while. Or a
						houseplant that will survive a week alone when you’re out of town
						for your friend’s wedding.
					</p>
					<h4>1. Monstera</h4>
					<p>
						Adaptable to almost all light conditions, and somewhat drought
						tolerant, the Monstera is a low maintenance, stunning tropical
						plant.
					</p>
					<p>
						Look out for: Crispy leaves mean the plant is getting sunburned or
						it’s not getting enough water, yellow leaves mean too much water.
						But don’t worry, Monsteras are incredibly forgiving and bounce back
						quickly!
					</p>
					<h4>2. Snake Plant</h4>
					<p>
						This hardy plant will do just fine in any type of light from low
						light areas to bright, full sun. Sansevieria don’t need a lot of
						water, are not sensitive to temperature changes, and don’t require
						any additional care. They ar also highly-sought after for their
						air-purifying properties.
					</p>
					<p>
						Look out for: Yellow, drooping leaves and funny smell, which could
						indicate overwatering.
					</p>
					<h4>3. ZZ Plant</h4>
					<p>
						Virtually indestructible, the ZZ Plant will do best if you basically
						ignore it. It thrives in areas where many plants don’t, making it
						one of the best office plants or bathroom plants. The ZZ Plant
						requires very little water and prefers to be kept on the dry side.
					</p>
					<p>
						Look out for: Yellow leaves mean the plant is getting too much
						water.
					</p>
					<h4>4. Spider Plant</h4>
					<p>
						This plant will do best in bright, indirect sunlight, and will
						tolerate low light areas where other plants might not thrive. Water
						your Spider Plant when the top 2-inches of soil are dry and it will
						be perfectly happy in your home.
					</p>
					<p>
						Look out for: Drooping can be a sign of underwatering while yellow
						or soft, brown leaves can be a sign of overwatering.
					</p>
					<h4>5. Philodendron Heartleaf</h4>
					<p>
						This adaptable plant thrives in indirect light and actually suffers
						if exposed to bright sunlight. It likes to be consistently watered,
						but is very forgiving if you forget to water it once in a while.
					</p>
					<p>Look out for: Yellowing leaves indicate overwatering.</p>
					<h4>6. Hedgehog Aloe</h4>
					<p>
						A cousin to the Aloe Vera, the Hedgehog Aloe plant needs a sunny
						spot in your home and can even be kept outside during the Summer.
						This low maintenance plant requires very little water, making it
						very easy to care for.
					</p>
					<p>
						Look out for: Wilting leaves in the summer mean under-watering,
						yellowing leaves probably mean overwatering.
					</p>
					<h4>7. Dracaena Giganta</h4>
					<p>
						This bright, variegated plant does best in low to medium light
						conditions. It only needs to be watered when the soil starts to feel
						dry, making it a perfect plant for anyone who is always on the go.
					</p>
					<p>Look out for: Brown tips mean the humidity is too low.</p>
					<h4>8. Ponytail Palm</h4>
					<p>
						This succulent likes bright light and will even tolerate the full
						sun. To keep your Ponytail Palm happy all you need to do is find it
						a sunny spot, remember to water it once in a while, and enjoy!
					</p>
					<h4>9. Aglaonemas</h4>
					<p>
						This lush plant thrives in nearly every light condition except
						direct sun—this makes it a perfect hallway or bathroom plant to help
						liven up your home! It does like to be kept moist, so consistent
						watering is important.
					</p>
					<p>
						Look out for: Tips of the leaves turning brown could be caused by
						the salts in your tap water.

					<h2>How to decorate with cutted leaves</h2>
					<p>
						Taking cuttings from our houseplants isn’t just for propagation
						purposes. Plant leaves also make wonderful accents, last for ages,
						and instantly add a dash of style to any corner or surface they
						adorn. Plus, it’s a great way to repurpose the foliage after
						pruning!
					</p>
					<p>
						Wondering how to take a cutting? There is no secret. Simply snip off
						a stem of your plant several inches below the leaf or at the base
						and place in water. Many plants will easily sprout roots on their
						own, and will stay “fresh” in their water for months if not years.
						Some plants (bulbs, for example, like Elephant’s Ears) will be more
						like flowers in the sense that will need to be replaced more
						frequently.
					</p>
					<h4>Go Big And Bold</h4>
					<p>
						Want to make a bold statement with just one leaf? Take a leaf from a
						big-leafed beauty like a Bird of Paradise or Monstera Deliciosa. Use
						it either as a centerpiece for a table or place on a side table as
						an easy accent.
					</p>
					<h4>Use Them As Wall Art</h4>
					<p>
						Walls looking a little bare? Consider making your own vertical
						garden with plant cuttings! And if a living wall seems a bit
						ambitious, start simple with three simple wall vases or propagation
						stations on a smaller surface area.
					</p>
					<h4>Double Up</h4>
					<p>
						While single leaves look gorgeous in their simplicity, there’s no
						reason why you can’t put multiple pieces in one glass for a fuller
						or richer effect. You can even mix up different textures to make a
						type of plant cutting bouquet!
					</p>
					<h4>Decorate A Sill</h4>
					<p>
						Unless they’re tiny, most indoor plants won’t fit on typical
						windowsills, but you know what will? Cuttings! Add some charm to a
						bathroom or kitchen windowsill with a simple cutting in your
						favorite glass or recycled bottle.
